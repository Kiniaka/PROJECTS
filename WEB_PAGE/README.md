## Project Description

In case of a 404 Not Found error, the web application will return the error.html page I created;

There is a form available on the message.html subpage through which users can describe their ideas and send them to me along with the contact details.

## Socket server has been created on port 5000. The work algorithm is as follows: the data entered into the form goes to the web application, which sends it further for processing using the socket (UDP protocol) to the Socket server. The Socket server processes the received byte string into a dictionary and saves it in the data.json file in the storage folder.
